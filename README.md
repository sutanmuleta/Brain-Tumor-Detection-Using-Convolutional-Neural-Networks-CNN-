# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
#Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for the automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The model leverages advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically the ResNet50 architecture, to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, potentially improving patient outcomes by facilitating timely and precise treatments.
